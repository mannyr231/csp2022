<center><p id="p2">So, my name is Manuel Ruelas and I am currently a sophmore at Santa Ana High School. In my frshmen year actually, I took Intro to Engineering online during 2020 and honestly it was pretty fun because I put effort into trying in that class. So far, I haven't earned any awards in any of my PLTW classes that I took.</p></center>
<center><p id="p3">The main reason as to why I want to take this Computer Science course is because I would love to go to a top school like Berkeley or Stanford and study Computer Science. Which is why I'm obviously taking this class to get a small headstart. I've always loved computers, ever since my mom got her old Toshiba laptop, I've explored the internet and even opened up her laptop to see what's inside out of curiousoty and I was just 6 years old.</p></center>
<center><p id="p4">Some personal hobbies that I do is mainly take sports photography for this school. (I take photos mainly of soccer and football but other sports I am thinking of doing.)There's some photos in the sports phorograpgy section of this website if you would like to see some of them, but here's a link to get there faster. </p></center>
